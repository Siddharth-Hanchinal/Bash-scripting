# Bash-scripting

### This is the repository where we are going to learn bash and would like to automate our project.

 Also I'll give names as 00 , 01 ,02 ,03 to indicate the sequence to learn.


 Few of the git commands that we would use during our upcoming journey

git clone repoName : Download the whole repository

git pull           : Download only the changes

git add fileName   : Git will start tracking the you're making on the file named fileName

git commit -m "msg Name" : Adding Msg to the commit / changes that you made .

git push : Your changes will be pushed to the repo.

### PS: Ensure you are inside the repo to executre the git commands ; We will perform clone once and pull multiple times
